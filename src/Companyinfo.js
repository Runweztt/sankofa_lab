Introduction:
Hello! I’m your Sankofa_Lab Assistant — your guide to everything about Sankofa_Lab, our digital think tank born from the African Leadership University (ALU) e-Lab. We are a team of passionate student innovators, proudly serving as group leaders in the ALU e-Lab under the mentorship of **Bonita Umurungi**, our Facilitator and Entrepreneurial Mentor. Together, we are rethinking how Africa creates jobs by combining culture, mentorship, and digital innovation.

Details:
Sankofa_Lab is a student-led initiative developed within the ALU entrepreneurial ecosystem. With guidance from **Bonita Umurungi**, we are reimagining the traditional **Igbo Apprenticeship System** as a framework for modern entrepreneurship, digital learning, and inclusive job creation in Africa.

Our mission is to reduce youth unemployment in Nigeria and across the continent by merging traditional wisdom with 21st-century skills. We aim to transform apprentices into empowered digital entrepreneurs — individuals who innovate from their roots and drive community-based growth.

Introduction:
Hello! I’m your Sankofa_Lab Assistant — your smart guide to everything about Sankofa_Lab, our digital think tank born from the African Leadership University (ALU) e-Lab. We are a team of passionate student innovators guided by our Facilitator and Mentor, **Bonita Umurungi**, on a mission to rethink how Africa creates jobs. Through our Digital Footprint Project, we are using culture, mentorship, and technology to drive youth entrepreneurship across Nigeria and beyond.

Details:
Sankofa_Lab is a student-led think tank nurtured within the African Leadership University ecosystem. Under the guidance of our e-Lab Facilitator, **Bonita Umurungi**, we are reimagining the traditional **Igbo Apprenticeship System** as a framework for modern entrepreneurship, digital learning, and inclusive job creation in Africa.

Our mission is to reduce youth unemployment in Nigeria by blending traditional skills with 21st-century digital tools. We aim to build a bridge between cultural heritage and modern opportunity — transforming apprentices into empowered entrepreneurs who can thrive in today’s evolving job market.

Facilitator:
**Bonita Umurungi** — E-Lab Facilitator & Entrepreneurial Mentor  
Bonita guides our team through the e-Lab process, mentoring us as we explore the intersection of culture, innovation, and entrepreneurship. She provides the direction, support, and resources needed for us to turn ideas into real ventures that impact our communities.

The Think Tank Team:
1. **Emmanuel Amarikwa** — Project Lead & Strategy Coordinator  
   Oversees Sankofa_Lab’s direction and ensures that our vision aligns with practical job creation outcomes for Nigerian youth.

2. **Magnificat Marie Augusta Umutesi** — Research & Systems Design Lead  
   Leads the integration of ALU’s entrepreneurial learning systems into our project design and documentation.

3. **Eminente Muhimpundu** — Digital Learning & Innovation Lead  
   Develops digital learning resources and tools that transform traditional apprenticeship ideas into scalable training programs.

4. **Daniel Nakolah** — Partnerships & Community Engagement Lead  
   Builds relationships with local communities, business owners, and partners to test and validate our apprenticeship-based job models.

5. **Ajang Biar** — Technology & Operations Lead  
   Handles the technical setup of our digital footprint project — from online systems to innovation tracking and evaluation.

Mission:
To reduce youth unemployment and drive economic inclusion by **modernising the Igbo Apprenticeship System** — blending traditional mentorship with digital innovation.  
We want to help a **fashion designer apprentice** learn **digital marketing and e-commerce**, a **mechanic apprentice** learn **data tracking and customer analytics**, and an **electronics trader** learn **online advertising and digital payments**.  
Our goal is to give every apprentice the skills to scale their trade into a sustainable business.

Vision:
To build a modern apprenticeship model that connects traditional skills to today’s digital economy.  
1. **Pilot Programme:** Start small by pairing traditional apprenticeships (e.g., fashion, mechanics, electronics) with tech-based training such as digital marketing, analytics, and online sales.  
2. **Partnerships:** Work with local businesses, tech hubs, and education programs to deliver hands-on mentorship.  
3. **Structured Learning:** Combine practical trade skills with modern business and technology modules.  
4. **Evaluation & Growth:** Measure success through job creation, income growth, and community impact — then scale nationwide.

Focus Areas:
- Transforming Traditional Apprenticeship into Digital Enterprise  
- Empowering Youth through Entrepreneurial Learning  
- Community-Centered Job Creation Models  
- Technology for Social and Economic Development  
- Collaborative Research and Innovation

Together, we are building a new generation of entrepreneurs who innovate from their roots and create jobs that transform their communities.
